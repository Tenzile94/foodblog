    excerpt: "Master the art of perfectly baked salmon with this restaurant-quality recipe featuring brown butter, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil.",
    content: `# Baked Salmon With Brown-Buttered Tomatoes & Basil

This elegant salmon dish combines the richness of brown butter with the freshness of summer tomatoes and aromatic basil. Perfect for a special dinner or when you want to impress your guests with a restaurant-quality meal at home.

## Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (6-8 oz each)
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. **Preheat your oven** to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the brown butter**: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter turns golden brown and develops a nutty aroma (about 3-4 minutes). Remove from heat immediately.

3. **Season the salmon**: Pat the salmon fillets dry and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.

4. **Arrange on baking sheet**: Place the salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet, skin-side down if your fillets have skin.

5. **Add tomatoes**: Scatter the halved cherry tomatoes around the salmon fillets.

6. **Drizzle with brown butter**: Spoon the brown butter over the salmon and tomatoes.

7. **Bake**: Place in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145°F.

8. **Finish with basil**: Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with torn basil leaves and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

## Pro Tips

- **Don't overcook**: Salmon is done when it flakes easily but is still moist in the center.
- **Brown butter timing**: Watch carefully - it goes from perfect to burnt quickly!
- **Fresh basil**: Add the basil after cooking to preserve its bright flavor and color.

This dish pairs beautifully with a crisp white wine and a simple green salad. The combination of the nutty brown butter, sweet tomatoes, and fresh basil creates a symphony of flavors that will make this recipe a family favorite.`,

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 3. **Slow Cook in Oven**

- For medium-rare: Remove at 125°F (52°C)

### 4. **Rest the Steak**
- Let the steak rest for 10-15 minutes
- This allows the juices to redistribute

### 5. **Sear to Perfection**
- Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat
